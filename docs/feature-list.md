## Add Days of Buffering

Add a calculation which shows how long your money would likely last if you never earned another cent based on your average spending from a chosen date range. We know that no month is 'average' but this should give you some idea of how much of a buffer you have. The actual calculation is the sum of all your budget accounts divided by the average daily outflow in the time range. Optionally, you can exclude negative credit card balances for better accuracy when carrying credit card debt.

This allows you to see how much you have available if you exclude the money "reserved" in your Credit Card Payments category group. You can turn this part of the feature off by selecting "Don't Include CC Payments".

If the "Show Available After Savings" feature is enabled, the "Available After Savings" amount is used as the starting point for the budget breakdown calculations.
